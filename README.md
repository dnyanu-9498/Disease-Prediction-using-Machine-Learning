# Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
The health care industry produces a huge amount of data. This data is not always made use to the
full extent and is often underutilized. Using this huge amount of data, a disease can be detected,
predicted or even cured. A huge threat to human kind is caused by diseases like heart disease,
cancer, Alzheimer's disease. We try to concentrate on disease prediction. Using machine learning
techniques, the disease can be predicted. The symptoms data such as chest pain, back pain,
congestion, constipation and so on is taken as input and then these features are modelled for
prediction. This model can then be used to predict future data. The algorithms like Decision
Tree, Random Forest, are used. The accuracy of the model using each of the algorithms is
calculated. Then the one with a good accuracy is taken as the model for predicting the disease.
Introduction:
+++++Problem Statement: The peoples are not aware of many diseases as they search on
internet for diseases names for specific symptoms.
++++++Project Idea: We thought about this issue, that how we can overcome this, we can
overcome this with the help of this project to predict the disease name and.
+++++++Scope: For now, this project has a limited scope that the analyzer algorithm works on
manual selection of symptoms. And also, the prediction is showing only the disease name. We
are trying to develop like analyze on current entries and predict the disease names also.
+++++++Functional Requirements:
 No specific hardware is required as it is a Desktop application.
 Compare given symptoms with input dataset
 Predict disease with the symptoms
+++++++++Non Functional Requirements:
 Disease Prediction Accuracy
 Disease Detection Consistency
 System Usability
